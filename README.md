## Description

In this project, I have built an HTML and JavaScript file to show current and future weather conditions.  The first task was building containers in the HTML to display a search input, a search history, a currents weather block, and a 5 day forecast for future weather. 

Retrieving weather conditions and projections from the API was fun and interesting.  Writing functions to display cities in the search history for later retrieval was a bigger and harder task that expected.  I would have liked to have added more input options to specify exact locations such as an option to enter the zip or an option to pick the the state if the the city had multiple locations.  This was a fun app that showed a lot of usage in the real world.
